Challenge of Manual Monitoring: With millions of surveillance cameras globally, it is nearly impossible to manually monitor each feed for violent incidents, leading to frequent missed or misinterpreted altercations.
Need for Automated Fight Detection: There is an urgent need for automated fight detection technology capable of efficiently processing and analyzing video data to accurately identify violent events in real-time.
Benefits of Automated Systems: Implementing such a system would enhance response times, improve safety in urban environments, and address the limitations of current monitoring practices.
